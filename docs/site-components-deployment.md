title: Site components deployment
---

In order to allow for a quick site setup, we make use of Docker containers. That lets us set up the website (client and server with its database), gameservers and optionally a Mumble server. In order to start looking into deploying your own tf2pickup.org instance, you have to have all files specified below. Examples are based on [tf2pickup.fi](https://tf2pickup.fi) website, domain and their Discord server.

## Prerequisites

- have everything mentioned in the [reverse proxy deployment](/docs/reverse-proxy-deployment) set up,
- have modern Docker and docker-compose version installed in your system, for docker-compose [use this guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and for Docker feel free to use guides for:
  - [Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04),
  - [Debian 10](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-debian-10),
  - [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/docker#Installation),
- prepare the following files in a separate folder, name it `tf2pickup.fi`, then place inside:
  - `.env` - stores variables needed for setting client, server, database and mumble containers up
  - `gameserver_1.env` - stores settings for the first game server _(optional)_
  - `gameserver_2.env` - stores settings for the second game server _(optional)_
  - `gameserver_3.env` - stores settings for the second game server _(optional)_
  - `docker-compose.yml` - contains all container settings
  - `data/config.ini` - contains all mumble server settings excluding SuperUser account password _(optional)_
  - `maps/` folder - it should contain all maps available for the game servers, `.bsp` extension,
  - `sourcetv1`, `sourcetv2`, `sourcetv3` folders - they will contain SourceTV demos from the pickup game servers.

Files `gameserver_{1,2,3}.env` are useful if you want to host game servers on the same host as the website. There is no `gameserver_3.env` example, but in fact the file syntax is the same, so you can basically edit values and just uncomment the part of the configuration in the `docker-compose.yml` file. In the same way, if you want to host 1 game server, just comment parts of the second game server and if you want to run game servers separately, just comment all parts of it in the aforementioned file.

The same rule goes for the Mumble server - if you want to run it outside Docker, aka use a local system installation, just don't provide needed configs for it and comment the part of the `docker-compose.yml` file for it.

### Mumble Server Configuration

# Timezone

```

### Setting up Steam API key

This is probably the easiest API key to get from all tasks here - open [Steam Web API Key site](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey), enter `tf2pickup.fi` in the **Domain Name** field, agree for *Steam Web API Terms of Use* and click **Register**.

![steam-api-key-register](/img/content/steam-api-key-register.png)

Then, copy and pass **Key** value to a `STEAM_API_KEY` variable.

![steam-api-key-registered](/img/content/steam-api-key-registered.png)

### Setting up Discord bot with channels

:::tip

This step is optional. Follow these steps only if you own a Discord which is directed for the pickup community.

:::

Discord integration enables:

- pickup gather up notification on a public channel,
- substitute notifications when they are needed during a game,
- administration notifications, such as:
  - player bans,
  - player unbans,
  - skill changes,
  - player role changes,
  - player nickname changes,
  - new player registrations,
  - game force-ends,
  - tf2pickup server starts.

In order to create a bot, you have to enter the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) in the Applications section. Then, click **New Application**.
![discord-create-new-application](/img/content/discord-create-new-application.png)

Add a name for the bot and click **Create**.

![discord-name-new-application](/img/content/discord-name-new-application.png)

After that set the avatar for the application:

![discord-bot-add-flag](/img/content/discord-bot-add-flag.png)

Then go to the bot section, click **Add Bot** and then **Yes, do it!** button on the notification.

![discord-add-new-bot](/img/content/discord-add-new-bot.png)

In the menu you can find a token, which you have to pass in the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` variable. Click **Copy** and note the token in your `.env` file.

You *should* untick the Public Bot option, since you don't really want to let anybody invite this bot anywhere else than your Discord server(s) (even if that would be useless, because the bot would send messages only on a specific server).

![discord-disable-public-invite](/img/content/discord-disable-public-invite.png)

Now you should head over to the OAuth2 section and create a URL allowing you to invite the bot on a server. In the **OAuth2 URL Generator** section under *Scopes* tick `bot` option. That should create a link below. Copy and open it.

![discord-bot-generate-invite-link](/img/content/discord-bot-generate-invite-link.png)

There you should choose the server on which your community is. You have to have `Manage Server` permissions in order to add the bot on it. Choose the server you want from the dropdown list and click **Authorize**.

![discord-invite-bot](/img/content/discord-invite-bot.png)

After adding the bot you should configure the channels for it. Administration notifications should be sent on a channel available only for the site staff. We suggest to set permissions in a way where the staff have `View Channel` and `Read Message History` permissions and the bot has the following ones:

- `View Channel`,
- `Send Messages`,
- `Embed Links`,
- `Attach Files`,
- `Read Message History`.

The bot should have the same permissions on a channel supposed to be a place for the pickup gather up and substitute notifications. After that, you should define the rest of the Discord Bot related variables. You should look at the following things:

The Discord server name is `Suomi TF2` and the pickup public notifications channel is `tf2pickupfi-yleinen`.

![tf2pickupfi-yleinen](/img/content/tf2pickupfi-yleinen.png)

You should also create a role for pinging players when the substitute is needed. In this example this role is called `Mixaajat`.

![sub-needed](/img/content/sub-needed.png)

The admin notifications channel is called `admin-ilmoitukset`.

![discord-admin-notifications-1](/img/content/discord-admin-notifications-1.png)

Therefore, you should define the rest of Discord Bot variables just like shown below:

```env
DISCORD_GUILD=Suomi TF2
DISCORD_QUEUE_NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNEL=tf2pickupfi-yleinen
DISCORD_QUEUE_NOTIFICATIONS_MENTION_ROLE=Mixaajat
DISCORD_ADMIN_NOTIFICATIONS_CHANNEL=admin-ilmoitukset
```

### Setting up Twitch stream integration

:::tip

This step is optional. Follow these steps only if you want to let people show up their streams on the main page of the pickup site.

:::

Setting it enables site users to integrate their tf2pickup accounts with Twitch, letting access their Twitch profiles through a Twitch link in an icon.

![player-profile](/img/content/player-profile.png)

Moreover, it will show up all Twitch streams on a left site of the main page.

![tf2pickup.fi](/img/content/tf2pickup.fi.png)

Go to the [Twitch Developers console](https://dev.twitch.tv/console) and register your new application by clicking **Register Your Application**:

![twitch-dev-console-register-your-application](/img/content/twitch-dev-console-register-your-application.png)

Define application name as `tf2pickup.fi` with OAuth Redirect URLs as `https://api.tf2pickup.fi/twitch/auth/return`. Choose any category - the best one for that purpose would be `Website Integration`. After defining that verify that you are not a bot and save.

Then, you will see the application list. Find `tf2pickup.fi` and select **Manage**. You will be able to see the **Client ID**, the value used in `TWITCH_CLIENT_ID` variable. The Client Secret will be hidden, press New Secret and confirm it in the popup. The Client Secret will show up like on the screenshot below:

![twitch-dev-console-tf2pickup.fi-api-settings](/img/content/twitch-dev-console-tf2pickup.fi-api-settings.png)

Pass this secret value to a `TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET` variable.

### Mumble channel setup example

## `docker-compose up -d`

In order to create and start all containers needed for letting site working, you just have to enter the `tf2pickup.fi` folder with all files prepared for a launch and execute `docker-compose up -d`. Each time you would like to stop the application stack, you are supposed to execute command `docker-compose stop` and `docker-compose start -d` when you start the stack. Containers have a `restart always` policy meaning the containers will always restart on fail, so it will also always start on a system boot as long as `docker.service` service is also starting on system boot.

## Using Mumble outside Docker stack

When doing it, you may end up with Mumble server service crashing, since it won't have needed permissions and files ownership for the `mumble-server` service user to let it read the certificate contents. We suggest you to use this in order to change them. You can save it as `mumble-certs.sh`, give it execution rights, run it manually and then leave it in crontab in the same way like you renew the certificates through `certbot`, so every time you get a certificate, the Mumble server will refresh the file permissions/ownership and refresh the Mumble server without restarting it.

- `mumble-certs.sh`:

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env sh
sudo chmod 755 /etc/letsencrypt/archive/
sudo chmod 755 /etc/letsencrypt/live/
sudo chgrp mumble-server -- /etc/letsencrypt/archive/tf2pickup.fi/privkey*.pem
sudo chmod 640 -- /etc/letsencrypt/archive/tf2pickup.fi/privkey*.pem
exec pkill -USR1 -F /run/mumble-server/mumble-server.pid
```

You can find an example how to set up the crontab jobs (in order to edit it, use `crontab -e` command as `root`) below:

```cron
0  1   20 * *   certbot certonly --non-interactive -d tf2pickup.fi -d '*.tf2pickup.fi' --dns-cloudflare --dns-cloudflare-credentials /root/.secrets/cloudflare --rsa-key-size 4096 --must-staple
0  1   25 * *   systemctl restart nginx
