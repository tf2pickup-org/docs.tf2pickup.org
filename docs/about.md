## The goal

tf2pickup.org is a service for every Team Fortress 2 competitive player to find their place.

It is a place for the beginners to play with more experienced players and learn from them, as well as for those
who have been playing competitive Team Fortress 2 for quite some time now and want to relax with their favorite game.

## The drive

What competitive Team Fortress 2 has been struggling with since always, is growing the playerbase. For those who are new to
the game, the options to play a good 6v6 or 9v9 match are quite limited. It has always been my opinion that you get better
at the game by playing with more experienced players and learning from them. **tf2pickup.pl** is aimed at making it possible
for players of all levels of experience to play together a well-balanced games, where there are no 5-0 rolls and there is a relaxed
and friendly atmosphere.

## The history

The tf2pickup.pl project was started in July 2019 as a small service for Polish TF2 competitive scene. We wanted to include
as many fresh players as possible and with double mixes it was pretty difficult. tf2pickup.pl's aim was to create a friendly
and welcoming environment where everyone interested in 6v6 format could find their place.

At first it was only the Polish service for 6v6 game mode, but soon enough we learned there is a demand for more game modes in more
countries. After [tf2pickup.pl](https://tf2pickup.pl/) initial success, we launched [hl.tf2pickup.pl](https://hl.tf2pickup.pl/),
Polish 9v9 and [tf2pickup.es](https://tf2pickup.es/), Spanish 6v6 pickups. Currently, we have also founded
[French](https://tf2pickup.fr/), [Czech/Slovak](https://tf2pickup.cz/), [German](https://tf2pickup.de/), [Post-Yugoslavian](https://yu.tf2pickup.eu) and [Finnish](https://tf2pickup.fi) 6v6 pickups and we are looking
forward to seeing many more.

## What tf2pickup.pl is

We give you an open-source, MIT-licensed project with all our best intentions and support. Although the project name is tf2pickup.**pl**, it
is not limited to Polish domain. In fact, anyone could launch their own instance of tf2pickup.pl, with their own branding and configuration.

## What tf2pickup.pl is NOT

tf2pickup.pl relies on admins to balance the games. There is no ELO system, no automatic skill recognition, nor a captain-pick system.
Each player has assigned a skill number on each class in the current game mode and that number is edited by hand, by admins.
Therefore it requires **a lot of admins' attention** and dedication to run proper tf2pickup.pl service. In return, players can expect
a properly balanced games that do not discourage new players and remain fun for the more experienced ones.
